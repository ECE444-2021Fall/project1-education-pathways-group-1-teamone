# Contributing to the application
We love your input!ðŸ˜Š We want to make the process as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a potential bugs
- Submitting a fix/patch
- Proposing new features
- Discussing about improvments

## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull request(PR). 
Instruction:
- Clone the repository to your local side, i.e `git clone https://github.com/ECE444-2021Fall/project1-education-pathways-group-1-teamone.git`
- Branch off of develop into feature branch, i.e. `git checkout -b <your_name/feature_name>`
- Develop on your feature branch and commit/push there
- When feature(s) is(are) ready, push up code and make a pull request(PR) from your new branch `<your_name/feature_name>` to `develop` branch
- Code gets reviewed, revised and merged into `develop` branch
- Eventually, when set of features (or singular feature) are(is) ready for release, team creates a PR from `develop` to `main` branch
- Main PR is then reviewed, revised, and merged into `main` branch

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ECE444-2021Fall/project1-education-pathways-group-1-teamone/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
A well-written bug report can help the developer team understand your problem and reply back to you with possible solutions ASAP.

**Great bug reports** tend to have:
- A brief summary/background of the bug
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific and clear
  - Provide sample code if applicable
- Your expected outcome
- What actually happens
- Additional Notes (possibly including other solutions you tried that didn't work)
