# Project description and purpose
The objective of the application is to provide both students and course coordinators at the University of Toronto (U of T) with course-related insights and guidance. This will be achieved by implementing an intuitive user interface, creating an intelligent course searching algorithm, providing a venue for course-related discussions, logging search query and widget interaction, and displaying course-specific information all in one platform. The primary benefit of the application is to save users time and effort during the course selection and curriculum planning process.
